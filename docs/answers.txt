4. Branches are used so features can be developed independently then merged once complete. Branches can also be used to seperate environments, one branch may house production code and is only updated during a release, while the dev branch may be getting new code push daily.

5. git log shows the branches history, git status shows the changes since the last commit. after a commit, git status should have no return.

6. git log --follow 'Vehicle.h" 

7. git log | grep "file"

8. Inheritance bases one class or object off of another. polymorphism is a method to preform different functions based on the object, or data type which calls the method.Encapsulation is restricting the methods that can operate on data to the method which the data is within.

9. In Integration manager workflow, every developer has two repos, a public one and a private one, whereas in Director Lieutenants, multiple developers share a few Lieutant repos.

10. 100 Developers utilizing a Centralized workflow would likely lead to far more conflicts in the code and developers would spend an excess amount of time resolve merge conflicts. Wheras in Dictator and Lieutenants the Dictator would have complete control of the 'blessed' repo and could more easily merge changes coming from the Lieutenants.
